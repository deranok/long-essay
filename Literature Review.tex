	\subsection{Sovereign Debt Default History}
	[Broad and narrow definition] 
	Sovereign debt default may be said to have occurred when a sovereign violates the legal terms of the debt contract. As noted by \citeA{tomz2013empirical}, this definition is too narrow since it overlooks situations where the sovereign country threatens to default and the creditors have to respond by accepting a new debt contract with less favourable terms than the original.Rating agencies therefore include the second condition for a default to create a much broader definition of defaults. \cite{beers2007default}
	
	
	[Reinhart Rogoff] Sovereign debt defaults are nothing new. \citeA{reinhart2008time} have shown that defaults go back to medieval times and have been a recurring theme throughout history.

	\cite{mendoza2012general} developed a DSGE model with business cycles for emerging markets to address the failing of previous DSGE models to address some problem [what problem?]. By linking productivity and defaults, their model showed that defaults occur with Total Factor Productivity (TFP) shocks of negative 1.3 times the standard deviation of TFP.
