  abstract = {Eurobond is a vital source of development finance for African economies. This is largely because of the benefits that it offers user countries which amongst other things include exclusion of conditionalities as a key requirement to subscription of much needed capital. This study seeks to identify how Eurobonds irrespective of its merits add to the debt stock of Ghana. It argues that first most Eurobonds secured are misapplied leading to a vicious cycle of debt. Also, issuance Eurobonds inversely related to the debt to GDP ratio. This study is guided by the concept of capital market liberalization which assesses the easing of restrictions on capital flows across a country’s border. The study concludes that Eurobond if not channeled into highly productive sectors of the economy consequently adds up to the public stock debt of the issuer state. The study recommends that Ghana must build macroeconomic frameworks reflecting the dimensions of new bond issues – for instance, reserve adequacy exercises to help prevent debt-servicing problems and help identify carry-costs. The establishment of sinking fund out of oil and gas proceeds to defray maturing debt is a step in the right direction. Also, it is recommended small percentage of the Eurobond proceeds are used in refinancing public debt for maximum economic benefit of the issued Eurobond. This measure is necessary if the average yield on Ghana’s issued Eurobond is to be prevented from outstripping GDP growth rates that makes interest payments.},

  abstract    = {A common belief in both academic and policy circles is that capital flows to the emerging periphery are excessive and ending in crises.  One of the most frequently mentioned culprits is the cycles of monetary easing and tightening in the financial centers.  Also, many focus on the role of crises in the financial center, pointing to excess international borrowing predating crises in the financial center and global retrenchment in capital flows in its aftermath.  I re-examine these views using a newly-constructed database on capital flows spanning 200 hundred years.  Extending the study of capital flows to the first episode of financial globalization has two major advantages: During this episode, monetary policy in the financial center is constrained by the adherence to the Gold Standard, thus providing a benchmark for capital flow cycles in the absence of an active role of central banks in the financial centers. Second, panics in the financial center are rare disasters that need to be examined in a longer historical episode.  I find that boom-bust capital flow cycles in the periphery are milder in the second episode of financial globalization when the financial center follows a cyclical monetary policy.  Also, cyclical monetary policy in the financial center is far more pronounced in times of crises in the financial center, cutting short capital flow bonanzas in the periphery and injecting liquidity in the aftermath of the crisis.},

We argue that, on average, Latin American countries have "graduated" in terms of their policy responses in the sense that they have been able to switch from procyclical to counteryclical policy responses.  This average response, however, masks a great deal of heterogeneity with some countries (such as Chile, Brazil, and Mexico) leading the graduation process and others (like Argentina and Venezuela) still showing procyclical policy responses.  We further show that countercyclical policy responses have been effective in reducing the duration and intensity of crises.  Finally, we relate our analysis to the current crisis in the Eurozone and argue that, like in many instances in Latin America, procyclical fiscal policy has increased the duration and intensity of the crisis.},

  abstract  = {The paper explores the impact of a binding external debt-servicing constraint on the  sectoral composition of government expenditures in the economies of Africa, where this  constraint has traditionally been most prevalent. Applying seemingly unrelated  regression (SUR) to 1975-94 five-year panel data for 35 countries, the paper finds that  the implied debt service burden adversely affects the share of public spending in the  social sector, with similar impacts on education and health. Despite evidence that such a  burden might also negatively influence public investment, the deleterious implications  of debt servicing appear to be primarily a social-sector phenomenon. The partial  elasticity on the sector's expenditure share is estimated at 1.5, which is by far the  highest among all the explanatory variables considered, including external aid, whose  estimated effect on the social sector is positive but with an elasticity of only 0.2. Aid  also positively affects public investment with a similar elasticity of 0.2. Constraint on  the executive exercises significant positive and negative impacts, respectively, on capital and agricultural spending, and also appears to positively influence health  expenditure. In addition, expenditures in the social sector have been tending upward,  despite the structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s, and even prior to the Highly  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiatives that have tended to emphasize spending in  the social sector.},

Why do creditors recover, in some cases, more than 90%, while in other cases they recover less than 10%? I find support for the Grossman and Van Huyk model of “excusable defaults”: countries that experience more severe negative shocks tend to have higher “haircuts” than countries that face less severe shocks. I discuss in detail debt restructuring episodes in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Greece. The results suggest that the haircut imposed by Argentina in its 2005 restructuring (75%) was “excessively high.” The other episodes’ haircuts are consistent with the model.},

  abstract    = {The G-8 Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) is the next step of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). There are two reasons why MDRI is unlikely to help poor countries. First, the amount of money at stake is trivial. The roughly $2 billion of annual debt payments to be relieved under MDRI amounts to roughly 0.01 percent of the GDP of the OECD countries%u2014a mere one-seventieth (1/70) of the quantity of official development assistance agreed to by world leaders on at least three separate occasions (1970, 1992, 2002). Second, the existence of debt overhang is a necessary condition for debt relief to generate economic gains. Since the world's poorest countries do not suffer from debt overhang, debt relief is unlikely to stimulate their investment and growth. The principal obstacle to investment and growth in the world%u2019s poorest countries is the fundamental inadequacy in these countries of the basic institutions that provide the foundation for profitable economic activity. In light of these facts, the MDRI may amount to a Pyrrhic victory: A symbolic win for advocates of debt relief that clears the conscience of the rich countries but leaves the real problems of the poor countries unaddressed.},

Public expenditure allocation to the social sector and to public investment is constrained by the need to pursue fiscal discipline in order to avert debt distress. Within a framework of public expenditure choice, the paper investigates the impact of the external debt-servicing constraint, as well as external aid, on government expenditure allocation in sub-Saharan Africa countries after the launch of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. Among the findings are: (i) the debt effect, while substantially lower than existing estimates for the pre-HIPC period, remains negative for the social sector, with education expenditure funding gaps, suggesting that appropriate measures must be undertaken in order to prevent the deleterious effects of debt, particularly on the social sector. Meanwhile, the additional finding that government effectiveness favours public investment as well as spending in the social sector suggests that increased attention on governance is called for.},
