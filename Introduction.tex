	\section{Background}
	A brief history of Ghana's experience with globalisation is given. Parallels are drawn to historical events in other parts of the world (Latin America and Asia) and some of the effects of globalisation on Ghana's economy is given.
	
	\subsection{Ghana Opens Up to International Finance}
	[Please start with when and how Ghana Started opening up its economy]\\
	In the face of fast depreciating currency, rising inflation, unemployment and power crisis, Ghana implemented a three-year arrangement with the IMF which was approved on April 3, 2015. The aim was to restore debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability in the country to foster a return to high growth and job creation, while protecting social spending \cite{IMF2018}. As part of the program, Ghana had to keep tight fiscal discipline, curtailing all excesses of public expenditure. Among others, the wage bill was of great concern. The government at the time froze all new recruitments to the public sector. It was decision which aside from starving some areas of the public sector of much needed human resources, also contributed to the unemployment situation in the country.
	
	Against the backdrop of the IMF program, the government had proceeded to issue the fourth, fifth and sixth eurobonds, most of the proceeds of which it claimed were used to retire older debts. Currently, the Ghana government has extended the IMF program to April 2019 and is planning to issue new bonds amidst wide speculation that the country may not be able to manage its debts once the IMF program ends \cite{Dontoh2019Jan}.
	
	[Origins]
	While the current events may not seem  to make much sense, it helps to look a bit at the history of the country in terms of its economy to get a clearer picture on the current happenings.

	[Main elements of the program]
	Among many other elements of SAPs, a few were always present: currency devaluation, removal of the state from the workings of the economy, the elimination of subsidies in an attempt to reduce expenditures and trade liberalisation \cite{ThingsFallAp}.

	For many years before 2006, Ghana had relied on debt forgiveness grants and interest forgiveness grants. The major change occurred in 2006 when Ghana finally obtained a relatively large debt cancellation of about \$4.7 billion. Since then, the country declared itself as a lower middle income country and the flow of grants has subsequently stopped.

	[The Eurobond Era]
	
	\subsection{Parallels With Other Countries That Eventually Faced Crises}
	The South American crises of 80's and 90's were also associated with similar capital flows, where there is no immediately apparent change in the underlying country but capital flows are study. \citeA{NBERc9796} noted that during the two decades preceding this period, capital flows to the South American countries were excessively high. Sometimes even higher than the country's GDP. Once this capital flows stop, the country is forced to make painful adjustments towards recovery. Politicians will then be faced with the question of default. 


	\subsection{Notable Challenges with Globalisation}
	
	One of the major issues that policy makers have to deal with in an open economy is the issue of balance of payments (Exports - Imports). Financing deficits implies the flow of capital (mostly in the form of debt) to the country. As shown above, Ghana had traditionally relied on Multilateral Debt from the IMF and the World Bank but since the debt forgiveness era ended, the country has to rely on the bond markets for financing support.
	
	Before the eurobond era, debt payments as a percentage of GDP
	was steadily declining. It has assumed its rising tendency again. As
	long as external debt stock keeps rising faster than GDP growth,
	this trend will continue.
